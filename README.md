# Lipz

Tool for lip sync animation targeted for games, machinema, and similar software. I keep this on Github for historical reasons. Since this tool was created, I've made multiple better versions of it, and dare I say it... I've now solved TV-quality automated lip animation.

See [sl-web-speech](https://github.com/erikh2000/sl-web-speech) for a library that processes speech audio to the Lipz format.

See [sl-web-face](https://github.com/erikh2000/sl-web-face) for a library that animates 2D faces with lip animation based on the Lipz format.

See [wisp](https://github.com/erikh2000/wisp) for a web app that provides a way to import speech audio, process for lip animation, and show the results.
